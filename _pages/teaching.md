I am passionate about promoting statistical thinking and teaching statistical methodologies, including practical techniques when working with data. I find from my experience that it is instructionally helpful to show students how a method is applied to solve a real-world problem. In my teaching, I value establishing trust with my students through clearly laying out the expectations and progressively building up to them step-by-step from the fundamentals.
